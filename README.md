Linear Regression
The aim of this project is to leverage Machine Learning to address several key tasks for the Sure Tomorrow insurance company.

Project Objectives:
Customer Similarity Identification: The aim is to find customers who are similar to a given customer, assisting the company's agents with targeted marketing strategies.

Insurance Benefit Prediction: The objective is to develop a prediction model that assesses whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit, determining if this model can outperform a basic dummy model.

Benefit Quantity Prediction: The aim is to use a linear regression model to predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive.

Data Protection: The project aims to create a data transformation algorithm that protects clients' personal data through masking or obfuscation. This algorithm must ensure that sensitive information remains secure while preserving the quality of the machine learning models. The focus will be on demonstrating the effectiveness of this data protection method rather than selecting the best predictive model.
